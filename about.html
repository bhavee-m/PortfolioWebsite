		I’m a second-year Communication Design student at Atlas Skilltech University.
                What began as a hobby gradually became my passion, and I’m grateful that design
                is something I now get to pursue as my career.
                <br>
                Beyond design, I absolutely love travelling and exploring the world.
                Personality-wise, I’m an ambivert—friendly, grounded, and deeply
                family-oriented. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio as much as
                I enjoyed creating it!
