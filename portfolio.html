        <p class="description">
            My portfolio showcases a curated selection of my best work from both my first and second year.
            By the end of my first year, I completed an internship at an advertising agency, where I had the
            opportunity to work on a project for Amul. The portfolio features a range of work including logo 
            design, branding, packaging, and product photography.
